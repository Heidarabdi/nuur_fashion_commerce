## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Note about the shared package
Before running builds or starting apps that depend on the workspace `shared` package, produce the compiled output and type declarations for it. This ensures non-TypeScript-aware runtimes and build steps (for example Bun build or other CI steps) will resolve the package correctly.

Build the shared package:

```bash
cd packages/shared
bun run build
```

(There is also a root-level `prepare`/`build:shared` helper that runs the shared build automatically when running the main `build` script.)

**Set up environment**  
Add Better Auth, Stripe, Cloudflare, and database credentials to a .env file.

**Database setup:**

```bash
cd backend
bun drizzle generate
bun drizzle migrate dev
```

**Run backend server:**

```bash
bun run server.ts
```

**Run frontend:**

```bash
cd apps/web && bun run dev
```

**Run mobile app:**

```bash
cd apps/mobile && expo start
```

## Integrations
